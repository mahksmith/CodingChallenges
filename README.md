# CodingChallenges
Coding challenges I've done for fun and learning.

For anyone reading this. I've been adding multiple versions for each challenge. The first version is what I submitted for the challenge in allotted time, the later versions are what I've added to properly complete the challenge 100% after the fact including testing.
